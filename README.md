# ASP.NET-Core-RC1-Simple-Project
The objectives of this project are to show you how to use ASP.NET Core RC1.
I follow the steps to write this project from [Plularsight course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/aspdotnet-core-1-0-fundamentals)

First you need to install any version of Visual Studio. You can use Microsoft DreamSpark if you're student and your university give you that chance. If you aren't a student or don't have a Microsoft DreamSpark account you can download free version of Visual Studio (Visual Studio Community 2015) from [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx). Also you need to install the ASP.NET Core from here(https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/getting-started.html). Just follow the installation steps and you'll get it.
